EMIR DASH [DEVELOPMENT STOPPED FOR NOW]

============

Emir Dash is a project I worked on for a short amount of time that is heavily influenced by the 
hit game "Geometry Dash".

============

HOW TO PLAY:

Similar to geometry dash, the main button is the left mouse button. Click on it to make your character
jump. You will NOT be able to hold it down, you will have to let go and click again for your character
to jump once more. 

Furthermore, you can click your escape button on your keyboard to pause the game. Once more, due to issues arising, I was not able to give an option that returns you to the menu! You will have to complete the game in one run or close out of it to revisit the menu. 

============

MUSIC:

Unfortunately due to time constraints and issues arising, the music will be one track playing at all times when playing the game. I might decide to update it if I revisit this project in the future once
more!
